        <body>
            <h1>Who is the best YouTuber to watch?</h1>
                <p>There are many factors to consider who to choose when watching Youtube for <em><strong>Entertainment</strong></em>. Below are a few things to consider when choosing who to subscribe to on YouTube:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Content</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What kind of content are you looking for? Are you simply looking for instructions? if so, choose the video that best describes what you are looking for.</li>
                            <li>If you are looking for someone to subscribe to for everyday content, take a look at their channel and a few of their videos, to determine if you like their style. If you are going to be watching this person
                                consistantly, you will need to enjoy they way they carry themselves and the way they present their information/material.</li>
                            <li>Personality of the creator is also very important. This will obviously change by the type of content you are watching. Political creators may take a more serious tone, while a video game channel may be goofy and light hearted.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Age restrictions</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Who is watching the content? Try to look for content that is friendly based on your age, or others watching age.</li>
                            <li>It helps to watch a few videos before making a decision so you can see how the person talks and what kind of language they use before subscribing.</li>

                        </ul>
                    <li>Frequency</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When looking for a channel to sub to, its important to know the creators upload schedule, or upload frequency. If you are looking for daily content, don't waste your time on a channel that only uploads once per week.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Reputation</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the creators reputation? This can be pretty easy to find as many YouTubers now days are like celebrities, especially in the YouTube community. Follow people that line up with your values and add value to your day/routine.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
            <h1>A few of my Favorite Creators/Channels</h1>

                            <li>I really like DrDisRespect because he is <strong>HILARIOUS!!!!</strong>
                                He plays a character that is really rude and sort of "trolls" other players. 
                                It also helps that he is really good at what he does. His streams are very high quality
                                and he also plays the games that I absolutely Love! I'm a giant kid at heart and watching this
                                channel alwasy gives me a much needed laugh! <strong>WARNING</strong>: there is sometimes harsh language
                                and sometimes crued humour on this channel.</li>

                            <li>NoahJ456 is the other major YouTuber that I watch. He is the number Call of Duty Zombies player on the planet and also has
                                the largest zombies YouTube channel. I like him because he is incredible to watch at the game but he is also very clean and family
                                friendly. He also cares deeply about the community, especially kids. Over the last two years, he has put together a charity Tournament that has
                                produced over $300,000 in money to help cancer research for kids. He is an all around good guy and his stream quality is good to high. It also helps that
                                he is very funny!</li>
